This could be through a convincing story, a promise of a reward, or even a false sense of urgency. If someone is trying to gain your trust, be wary and take your time to research the person or company.<br><br>Emotional: Scammers often try to create an emotional connection with their victims. They may use flattery, sympathy, or guilt to manipulate you into doing something. If someone is trying to emotionally manipulate you, be cautious and donâ€™t let your emotions cloud your judgment.<br><br>Asks for Action: Online scammers frequently ask you to call a number, click a link, or log in to an account. This is often a way for them to gain access to your personal information or money. Be wary of any requests for action and take the time to verify the person or company before you take any action.<br><br>Unexpected Contact: If you receive an unexpected contact from someone, be cautious. Scammers often use fake accounts or contact information to reach out to potential victims. Be sure to verify the identity of the person before engaging in any conversation.<br><br>Asks for Personal Info: Scammers often ask for personal information such as your address, bank account details, or credit card numbers. Never give out this information unless you are absolutely sure the person or company is legitimate.<br><br>Overpays You: If someone offers to pay you more than the agreed amount, be wary. This is often a sign of a scammer trying to get you to return the excess money.<br><br>Promises Something: If someone promises you something that seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any promises of large rewards or easy money.<br><br>Wire Transfer Request: If someone asks you to send money via a wire transfer, be cautious.
