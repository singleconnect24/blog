                     <p>Doublelist is an online personals website that has been around since 2018. It was created as a replacement for Craigslist's personals section, which was shut down in response to the passage of the FOSTA-SESTA legislation. Since then, Doublelist has gained a following among people who are looking for casual encounters, dating, or simply making new friends. However, some users have been asking if Doublelist is still free to use. In this article, we will examine this question in detail.</p>
<p>Doublelist is Still Free to Use</p>
<p>The short answer to the question of whether Doublelist is still free to use is yes. As of this writing, Doublelist does not charge users to create an account, post ads, or browse other users' ads. This means that anyone can use the website without paying any fees.</p>
<p>Simplicity is Key on Doublelist</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of Doublelist is its simplicity. The website makes it easy for users to find people who are looking for the same things they are. Users can post ads just like they could on Craigslist, and they can make use of filters to search for what they're looking for. The filters include location, age, gender, sexual orientation, and the type of relationship the user is seeking. This makes it easy for users to find potential matches quickly.</p>
<p>Doublelist is Not Without Its Issues</p>
<p>While Doublelist is a popular website, it's not without its issues. For one thing, the website has faced criticism for allowing illegal activity, such as prostitution and sex trafficking, to take place on its platform. This has led to calls for Doublelist to be shut down or for stricter moderation of its content.</p>
<p>In addition, some users have reported encountering fake ads or scams on Doublelist. These can take the form of people pretending to be someone they're not or asking for money or personal information. It's important for users to be cautious when using Doublelist, just as they would be on any other website.</p>
<p>Doublelist is still free to use. This means that anyone can create an account, post ads, and browse other users' ads without paying any fees. The website's simplicity and user-friendly design make it easy to find potential matches quickly. However, Doublelist is not without its issues, including the potential for illegal activity and fake ads. As with any website, users should exercise caution when using Doublelist and be mindful of their personal safety.</p>
