With the right preparation and attitude, you can make your first date a success. Here are some tips on what not to do on a first date.<br><br><strong>Don't Talk About Yourself Endlessly</strong><br><br>First dates are all about getting to know each other. While it's important to share about yourself, don't make the conversation all about you. Ask questions about your date, and be an engaged listener. Show that you're interested in getting to know them better.<br><br><strong>Don't Quiz Them</strong><br><br>It's natural to want to learn more about someone on a first date, but be careful not to make it feel like an interrogation. Ask open-ended questions that will help you get to know them better, but don't pepper them with questions that are too personal.<br><br><strong>Don't Dismiss Them Because They're Not Your Type</strong><br><br>It's easy to make snap judgments about someone, especially when you first meet them. Try to keep an open mind, and don't dismiss someone just because they're not your type. You never know what can happen when you give someone a chance.<br><br><strong>Don't Have Your Phone on the Table</strong><br><br>Your phone should be tucked away during a first date. Having your phone on the table sends the message that you're not present or interested in getting to know your date. Put your phone away, and give your date your full attention.<br><br><strong>Don't Talk About Your Ex</strong><br><br>Talking about your ex is a major no-no on a first date. Not only is it a red flag for your date, but it also shows that you're not ready to move on. Keep the conversation focused on the present and the future.<br><br><strong>Don't Avoid Eye Contact</strong><br><br>Eye contact is an important part of communication. If you're avoiding eye contact, it sends the message that you're not interested or engaged in the conversation. Make sure to maintain eye contact throughout the date to show that you're paying attention.<br><br><strong>Don't Drink Too Much Alcohol</strong><br><br>Alcohol can be a great way to relax on a first date, but it's important to not overdo it. Getting too drunk can make you look unprofessional and make your date uncomfortable. Stick to one or two drinks, and make sure to keep your wits about you.<br><br><strong>Don't Wear Something Uncomfortable</strong><br><br>First impressions are important, so make sure to dress to impress. But don't wear something that makes you uncomfortable. You should feel confident in your outfit, and make sure it's appropriate for the occasion.<br><br>These are just a few tips on what not to do on a first date. Remember to be yourself, be open-minded, and be present. With the right attitude and preparation, you can make your first date a success.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://siteoff.github.io/registration"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA1.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
