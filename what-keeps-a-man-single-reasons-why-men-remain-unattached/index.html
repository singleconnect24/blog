Unfortunately, many men feel that they don’t measure up to the societal standard of attractiveness. As a result, they may be less likely to approach someone or be approached by someone else.<br><br><strong>Height</strong><br>Height is another factor that can influence a man’s single status. Men who are shorter than average may feel that they are not as attractive as taller men and may be less likely to find a partner.<br><br><strong>Baldness</strong><br>Baldness is another physical trait that can affect a man’s single status. Men who are bald may feel that they are not as attractive as men with a full head of hair and may be less likely to find a partner.<br><br><strong>Lack of Confidence</strong><br>Finally, lack of confidence can be a major factor in why some men remain single. Men who lack confidence may be less likely to approach someone or be approached by someone else.<br><br>The study has revealed that a number of factors can contribute to why some men remain single.
