According to Toronto-based divorce lawyer Justin Lee, men should always pay on first dates as a way to check if the other person is 'entitled.' <br><br>Lee, who is active on TikTok, believes that paying for a date is the "best litmus test" for a partner. In this article, we will explore why men should pay for dates and what it could mean for the future of the relationship. <br><br>The 'Entitlement' Test<br><br>When a man pays for a date, it is a way for him to check if his date is 'entitled.' This means that the woman expects the man to pay for her and is not willing to contribute financially. If a woman is willing to contribute, it could be a sign that she is not expecting the man to take care of her financially. <br><br>Lee believes that this is an important test to see if the relationship will be successful in the long run. If a woman is expecting the man to pay for her, it could be a sign that she is not willing to be an equal partner in the relationship. <br><br>A Sign of Respect<br><br>Paying for a date is also a sign of respect. It shows that the man is willing to take care of the woman and make sure that she is comfortable. This could be a sign that the man is willing to put in the effort to make the relationship work. <br><br>It could also be a sign that the man is willing to invest in the relationship and show that he cares about the woman. This could be a sign that the man is willing to go the extra mile to make the relationship successful. <br><br>A Sign of Commitment<br><br>Paying for a date could also be a sign of commitment. If a man is willing to pay for a date, it could be a sign that he is willing to invest in the relationship and make it work. This could be a sign that the man is serious about the relationship and is willing to make the necessary sacrifices to make it successful. <br><br>In conclusion, men should pay for dates as a way to check if their date is 'entitled.' It is also a sign of respect and commitment that could be a sign that the man is serious about the relationship. <br><br>It is important to remember that paying for a date does not guarantee that the relationship will be successful. It is just one way to show that the man is willing to invest in the relationship and make it work.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
