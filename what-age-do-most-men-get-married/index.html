In the United States, the median age for men to get married has been steadily increasing over the past two decades. This article will explore the median age of men in the United States at their first wedding from 1998 to 2021.<br><br><strong>Median Age of U.S. Americans at their First Wedding 1998-2021, by Sex</strong><br><br>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median age for the first wedding among women in the United States stood at 28.6 years in 2021. For men, the median age was 30.6 years. This is an increase from 1998, when the median age for women was 25.1 years and for men was 27.2 years.<br><br>The trend of increasing median age for first weddings has been observed across all age groups, with the greatest increase among those aged 30 to 34. In 2021, the median age for men in this age group was 36.2 years, compared to 33.2 years in 1998. For women, the median age in 2021 was 34.1 years, compared to 30.3 years in 1998.<br><br>The median age for first weddings has also increased among those aged 35 to 39. In 2021, the median age for men in this age group was 39.7 years, compared to 36.7 years in 1998. For women, the median age in 2021 was 37.5 years, compared to 34.2 years in 1998.<br><br><strong>Factors Contributing to the Increase in Median Age for First Weddings</strong><br><br>There are several factors that have contributed to the increase in median age for first weddings in the United States. One of the most significant factors is the increasing number of women pursuing higher education. In 2021, more than half of all bachelor's degrees were awarded to women, compared to just over one-third in 1998. This has resulted in more women delaying marriage until they have completed their education and established their careers.<br><br>Another factor is the increasing cost of weddings. The average cost of a wedding in the United States in 2021 was over $30,000, compared to just over $20,000 in 1998. This has led many couples to delay marriage until they have saved enough money to cover the cost of their wedding.<br><br>The median age for first weddings among men in the United States has been steadily increasing over the past two decades. This trend is largely attributed to the increasing number of women pursuing higher education and the increasing cost of weddings. As more women pursue higher education and the cost of weddings continues to rise, it is likely that the median age for first weddings among men will continue to increase in the future.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
