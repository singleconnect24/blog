While physical intimacy is an important part of a marriage, it is not the only thing that makes a marriage strong. There are many other aspects of a marriage that can help it survive, even if there is no physical intimacy.<br><br>Understanding the Needs of Each Partner<br><br>The first step in determining if a marriage can survive without intimacy is to understand the needs of each partner. Every person has different needs and desires when it comes to physical intimacy. Some people may need more physical intimacy than others, while some may not need any at all. It is important to understand what each partner needs and wants in order to make sure that the marriage is healthy and happy.<br><br>Communication<br><br>Communication is key in any relationship, and it is especially important in a marriage. It is important to talk openly and honestly about any issues that may arise in the marriage, including physical intimacy. If one partner is not happy with the lack of physical intimacy, it is important to talk about it and come up with a plan to address the issue. This can help to ensure that both partners are happy and that the marriage can survive without physical intimacy.<br><br>Finding Other Ways to Connect<br><br>If physical intimacy is not an option, it is important to find other ways to connect with each other. This can include spending quality time together, going on dates, and engaging in activities that both partners enjoy. This can help to keep the marriage strong and can help to make up for the lack of physical intimacy.<br><br>Working on the Issue<br><br>Even if one or both people aren't happy with the lack of physical intimacy, that's an issue that can be worked on and improved over time. It is important to be patient and understanding with each other and to be willing to make changes if necessary. With patience and understanding, it is possible to make improvements and to make the marriage stronger.<br><br>It is possible for a marriage to survive without physical intimacy.
