That's why we've rounded up seven things to avoid bringing up during your conversation to make sure it all goes smoothly.<br><br><strong>Too Much Talk About Your Ex</strong><br><br>When you’re on a date, it’s important to focus on the person you’re with and not your past relationships. Talking about your ex can make your date feel like they’re being compared to someone else and that’s not a good way to start a relationship.<br><br><strong>Any Weirdly Personal Questions</strong><br><br>When you’re getting to know someone, it’s important to keep the conversation light and fun. Asking overly personal questions can make your date feel uncomfortable and can make the conversation awkward.<br><br><strong>Sex Talk and Only Sex Talk</strong><br><br>When you’re on a date, it’s important to remember that you’re getting to know someone and not just talking about sex. Talking about sex can make your date feel like you’re only interested in one thing and that’s not a good way to start a relationship.<br><br><strong>Love Bombing</strong><br><br>Love bombing is when someone showers you with excessive compliments and attention in order to manipulate you. It’s important to remember that if someone is love bombing you, it’s not genuine and it’s not a good way to start a relationship.<br><br><strong>Food Shaming</strong><br><br>Food shaming is when someone comments on what someone else is eating in a negative way. It’s important to remember that everyone has different tastes and it’s not okay to judge someone for what they’re eating.<br><br><strong>Comments About Someone's Age</strong><br><br>It’s important to remember that age is just a number and it’s not okay to make comments about someone’s age. Making comments about someone’s age can make them feel uncomfortable and it’s not a good way to start a relationship.<br><br><strong>Rageful Diatribes</strong><br><br>When you’re on a date, it’s important to remember to keep the conversation positive. Ranting about something or someone can make your date feel uncomfortable and it’s not a good way to start a relationship.<br><br><strong>Judging Their Dating History</strong><br><br>It’s important to remember that everyone has a different dating history and it’s not okay to judge someone for it. Judging someone’s dating history can make them feel uncomfortable and it’s not a good way to start a relationship.<br><br>When you’re on a date, it’s important to remember to keep the conversation light and fun. Avoiding certain topics can help make sure that your date goes smoothly and that you both have a good time.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
