This frequency shows that the guy is thinking about you and wants to keep in touch. Of course, if you strike up a conversation, then you may receive more messages.</p><h3>Importance of Content</h3><p>It is not just the frequency of messages that indicates his interest, but also the content of the messages. Does he ask about your day, share personal stories, or make plans with you? These are all positive signs that he likes you. On the other hand, if his messages are short and lack substance, it could indicate a lack of interest.</p><p>The most important thing to look for when it comes to a guy texting you is whether or not you are on his mind. A few text messages a day are proof that he likes you and wants to keep in touch. Pay attention to both the frequency and content of his messages to get a better understanding of his feelings towards you.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
