There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as it depends on a variety of factors such as personal preferences, relationship dynamics, and cultural norms.</p><h6>Men vs. Women</h6><p>On average, men reported waiting about five dates before having sex, while women reported a preference for waiting closer to nine dates. These results suggest that there is a gender difference in the timing of sex in dating relationships, with men generally being more open to having sex earlier on, and women tending to wait longer.</p><h6>Overall Average</h6><p>Despite these differences, the overall average number of dates before having sex was about eight. This suggests that, on average, couples are waiting between five and nine dates before they decide to become sexually intimate.</p><h6>Considerations</h6><p>It's important to note that these numbers are simply averages and do not necessarily apply to everyone. Some people may feel comfortable having sex after just one or two dates, while others may wait several months or even longer. Ultimately, the decision to have sex is a personal one that should be based on individual comfort levels, relationship dynamics, and any other factors that are important to you.</p><p>In conclusion, the number of dates before having sex can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors. On average, men tend to wait about five dates, while women prefer to wait closer to nine. However, the overall average is about eight dates. Ultimately, the decision to have sex is a personal one that should be based on individual comfort levels and relationship dynamics.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
