Meet the friends, first. Sussman suggests introducing your partner to your friends before your family, but says you should wait at least three months before doing it. This gives you and your partner time to get to know each other and build a strong foundation for your relationship.<br><br>Once you have established a strong connection with your partner, it is time to introduce them to your friends. Invite your friends over for dinner or drinks and make sure you are both comfortable with the situation.
