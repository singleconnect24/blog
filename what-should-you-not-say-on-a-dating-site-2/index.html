As you’re crafting your profile, there are certain things you should never put on a dating profile. From generic information to lies and exaggerations, here are five things you should never put on a dating profile.<br><br>What You're *Not* Looking For<br><br>One of the biggest mistakes you can make on a dating profile is to list out what you’re not looking for. While it’s important to be honest about what you want in a relationship, including criteria for who shouldn’t swipe left or message you is just a real Debbie Downer move. People don’t want to feel like they’re being judged or excluded before they even get a chance to know you. Instead, focus on what you’re looking for in a partner and let the other person decide if they fit the bill.<br><br>Anything Too Generic<br><br>It’s easy to get stuck in a rut when it comes to writing a dating profile. You might be tempted to list generic information like your hobbies, favorite movies, or other things that everyone else has listed. However, this is a surefire way to get lost in the shuffle. Instead, try to be more specific and creative with your profile. Describe a funny story related to one of your hobbies or share a favorite quote from a movie that you love. This will help you stand out from the crowd and give potential matches a better sense of who you are.<br><br>Sarcasm About Being on 'The Apps'<br><br>It’s easy to make jokes about being on dating apps, but it’s important to remember that not everyone is comfortable with online dating. Making sarcastic comments about being on “the apps” can come off as judgmental and make potential matches feel like you’re not taking the process seriously. Instead, focus on being positive and optimistic about the possibilities that online dating can bring.<br><br>Lies (or Even Exaggerations)<br><br>It can be tempting to stretch the truth a bit on your dating profile, but it’s important to remember that honesty is the best policy. Lying or exaggerating about your job, hobbies, or interests can lead to a lot of awkwardness down the line. If you’re caught in a lie, it can be difficult to recover and build trust with your potential match. Instead, focus on being honest and open about who you are and what you’re looking for.<br><br>*No Information*<br><br>It can be intimidating to write a dating profile, but it’s important to remember that potential matches won’t be able to get to know you if you don’t provide any information. Leaving your profile blank or only providing a few generic sentences won’t help you stand out from the crowd. Take the time to write a thoughtful profile that gives potential matches a better sense of who you are and what you’re looking for.<br><br>Creating a successful dating profile can be tricky, but it’s important to remember that there are certain things you should never put on a dating profile. From what you’re not looking for to lies and exaggerations, avoid these five things to ensure that your profile is successful. With a little bit of effort, you can create a profile that will help you find the perfect match.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://o.tr1net.com/click?pid=16547&offer_id=76"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA2.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
