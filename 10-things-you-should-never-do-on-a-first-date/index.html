It's important to make a good first impression and make sure you don't do anything that could ruin the date. Here are 10 things you should never do on a first date.<br><br><strong>1. Talk About Yourself Endlessly</strong><br><br>When you're on a first date, it's important to get to know the other person. Don't make the mistake of talking about yourself endlessly. Ask questions and let the other person talk about themselves too.<br><br><strong>2. Quiz Them</strong><br><br>Don't make the date feel like an interrogation. Asking questions is a great way to get to know someone, but don't bombard them with questions. Let the conversation flow naturally and give them time to answer.<br><br><strong>3. Dismiss Them Because They're Not Your Type</strong><br><br>Don't judge someone based on their looks or other superficial qualities. You never know, they might surprise you. Give them a chance and get to know them before making any decisions.<br><br><strong>4. Have Your Phone on the Table</strong><br><br>Having your phone on the table is a major turn-off. Not only is it rude, but it also shows that you're not paying attention to the other person. Keep your phone in your pocket or bag and give the other person your full attention.<br><br><strong>5. Talk About Your Ex</strong><br><br>Talking about your ex on a first date is a huge no-no. It's not only disrespectful to the other person, but it also shows that you're not ready to move on. Keep the conversation focused on the present and avoid bringing up your past relationships.<br><br><strong>6. Avoid Eye Contact</strong><br><br>Eye contact is important when it comes to making a good first impression. Don't avoid eye contact as it can make the other person feel uncomfortable. Make sure to look them in the eye when you're talking and listening.<br><br><strong>7. Drink Too Much Alcohol</strong><br><br>Having a drink or two on a first date is fine, but don't overdo it. Drinking too much alcohol can make you look unprofessional and sloppy. Stick to one or two drinks and keep your alcohol consumption in check.<br><br><strong>8. Wear Something Uncomfortable</strong><br><br>When you're going on a first date, it's important to wear something that makes you feel comfortable and confident. Don't wear something that's too tight or too revealing. Wear something that you feel good in and that you can move around in easily.<br><br><strong>9. Get Too Personal</strong><br><br>When you're on a first date, it's important to take things slow. Don't get too personal or ask too many intimate questions. Let the conversation flow naturally and don't push the other person to share too much too soon.<br><br><strong>10. Try Too Hard</strong><br><br>When you're on a first date, it's important to be yourself. Don't try too hard to impress the other person. Just be yourself and let your personality shine through.<br><br>Following these tips will help you make a good first impression and ensure that your first date goes smoothly. Keep these tips in mind and have a great time!</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://simpledatings.life/?u=db5p60t&o=vyvzflc" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://github.com/singleconnect24/img/blob/main/clickUSA2.jpg" alt="USA Dating"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
