                     <p>Sexual intimacy is an essential part of any romantic relationship. It creates a strong emotional bond between partners and serves as a source of pleasure and connection. However, not all couples experience a healthy sexual relationship, and some may go through periods of being sexless. The question is, how long can a sexless relationship last? This article aims to answer this question based on research findings.</p>
<p><strong>The Survey Results</strong></p>
<p>A survey conducted by the Bad Girls Bible on 1,000 people in relationships found that most people are willing to wait 18 months in a sexless relationship before calling it quits. This is almost two years, which is a significant amount of time to be in a relationship without any sexual intimacy.</p>
<p>The study also found that 1 in 20 people have cheated because their partner refused sex. This is a clear indication of how important sex is in a relationship and how a lack of it can lead to severe consequences. Infidelity can cause significant emotional pain and can be a reason for the breakdown of a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Factors That Affect the Duration of a Sexless Relationship</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Communication</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Communication is vital in any relationship, including a sexless one. If partners are open and honest with each other about their feelings, they can work together to overcome the issues that are causing the lack of sexual intimacy. However, if communication is lacking, the problem may go unresolved, leading to a longer duration of a sexless relationship.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em>Reasons for a Sexless Relationship</em></li>
</ol>
<p>There can be various reasons for a sexless relationship, including physical or mental health issues, stress, relationship problems, or simply a lack of sexual desire. The duration of a sexless relationship can depend on the cause of the problem. For instance, if a physical health issue is causing the problem, it may take longer to resolve, leading to a longer duration of a sexless relationship.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em>Personal Values and Beliefs</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Personal values and beliefs can also influence how long a sexless relationship can last. For example, some people may consider sex as a crucial aspect of a relationship and may not be willing to wait for an extended period before calling it quits. On the other hand, some people may not place much importance on sex and may be willing to wait longer before deciding to end the relationship.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><em>Outside Influences</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Outside influences, such as cultural or societal norms, can also play a role in the duration of a sexless relationship. In some cultures or societies, sex is considered a taboo topic, and discussing it openly may be frowned upon. This can lead to partners being hesitant to address the issue, leading to a longer duration of a sexless relationship.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the duration of a sexless relationship can depend on various factors, including communication, reasons for the problem, personal values and beliefs, and outside influences. The survey conducted by the Bad Girls Bible found that most people are willing to wait 18 months in a sexless relationship before calling it quits. However, it is essential to note that every relationship is unique, and the duration of a sexless relationship can vary based on individual circumstances. Communication, honesty, and a willingness to work together are crucial to overcoming any issues that arise in a relationship, including a lack of sexual intimacy.</p>
