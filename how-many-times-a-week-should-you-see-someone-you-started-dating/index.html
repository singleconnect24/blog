It is an exciting time, but it can also be a bit overwhelming, especially when it comes to deciding how often you should see each other.</p><h5>Aiming for a Date a Week:</h5><p>According to relationship experts, a good benchmark to aim for is one date a week. This frequency of seeing each other is enough to give time to the relationship and keep the connection strong, without meeting up so little that the connection fizzles out.</p><h5>Avoiding Over-Attachment:</h5><p>In the early stages of infatuation, it is tempting to want to see someone you are dating as often as possible. However, this can lead to over-attachment and can be detrimental to the relationship in the long run.</p><p>Ultimately, the frequency of seeing someone you are dating will depend on your individual schedules, preferences, and the pace at which you both want the relationship to grow. But, a good rule of thumb is to aim for one date a week.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
