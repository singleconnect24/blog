Here are some of the signs that someone isn't right for you.<br><br>You Want a Relationship More Than You Want the Person<br>If you find yourself wanting a relationship more than you want the person, then it's a sign that something isn't right. You should be able to have a connection with the person you're with and be excited to be around them. If you're more focused on the idea of being in a relationship than the actual person, then it's a sign that you should move on.<br><br>You're Self-Conscious<br>If you're constantly feeling self-conscious around the person you're with, then it's a sign that something isn't right. You should be able to be yourself and feel comfortable in the relationship. If you're constantly worrying about what the other person is thinking or feeling, then it's a sign that you should move on.<br><br>The Relationship Doesn't Recover From Arguments<br>Arguments are a normal part of any relationship, but if the relationship doesn't recover from arguments, then it's a sign that something isn't right. If you find yourself constantly arguing and not being able to resolve the issues, then it's a sign that the relationship isn't working and it's time to move on.<br><br>Your PDA is More Affectionate Than in Private<br>If you find yourself being more affectionate in public than in private, then it's a sign that something isn't right. You should be able to show affection to the person you're with in both public and private. If you find yourself only being affectionate in public, then it's a sign that the relationship isn't working and it's time to move on.<br><br>You're Hoping Some Things About Them Will Change<br>If you find yourself hoping that certain things about the person you're with will change, then it's a sign that something isn't right. You should be able to accept the person for who they are and not be hoping that they will change. If you find yourself hoping that certain things about them will change, then it's a sign that the relationship isn't working and it's time to move on.<br><br>You Don't Trust Them<br>Trust is an important part of any relationship and if you find yourself not trusting the person you're with, then it's a sign that something isn't right. You should be able to trust the person you're with and feel secure in the relationship. If you find yourself not trusting the person, then it's a sign that the relationship isn't working and it's time to move on.<br><br>You Have to Pretend to be Interested, or Vice Versa<br>If you find yourself having to pretend to be interested in the person you're with, or vice versa, then it's a sign that something isn't right. You should be able to be genuinely interested in the person you're with and not have to pretend. If you find yourself having to pretend to be interested, or vice versa, then it's a sign that the relationship isn't working and it's time to move on.<br><br>Knowing when someone isn't right for you can be difficult, but it's important to be able to recognize the signs. If you find yourself wanting a relationship more than you want the person, feeling self-conscious, not being able to recover from arguments, being more affectionate in public than in private, hoping certain things about them will change, not trusting them, or having to pretend to be interested, then it's a sign that the relationship isn't working and it's time to move on.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://siteoff.github.io/registration"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA2.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
