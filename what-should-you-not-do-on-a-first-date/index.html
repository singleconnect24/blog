To ensure your first date goes as smoothly as possible, here are some tips on what not to do.<br><br><strong>Don’t Talk About Yourself Endlessly</strong><br><br>When you’re on a first date, it’s important to remember that it’s a two-way conversation. Don’t talk about yourself endlessly, as this can make the other person feel like they’re not being heard. Ask them questions about themselves and take an interest in what they have to say.<br><br><strong>Don’t Quiz Them</strong><br><br>It’s natural to want to get to know the other person, but don’t make it feel like an interrogation. Ask questions, but don’t bombard them with too many at once. Let the conversation flow naturally and don’t be afraid to take pauses.<br><br><strong>Don’t Dismiss Them Because They’re Not Your Type</strong><br><br>It’s easy to be judgmental when you’re on a first date, but try to keep an open mind. Don’t dismiss them because they’re not your type or because you don’t think you’ll get along. Give them a chance and you may be surprised at how well you get along.<br><br><strong>Don’t Have Your Phone on the Table</strong><br><br>It’s important to be present and engaged in the conversation when you’re on a first date. Having your phone on the table is a distraction and it can make the other person feel like you’re not interested in what they have to say. Put your phone away and give them your full attention.<br><br><strong>Don’t Talk About Your Ex</strong><br><br>Talking about your ex on a first date is a big no-no. It can make the other person feel uncomfortable and it can give them the wrong impression about you. Keep the conversation focused on the present and don’t bring up your past relationships.<br><br><strong>Don’t Avoid Eye Contact</strong><br><br>Eye contact is important when you’re on a first date. It shows that you’re engaged in the conversation and that you’re interested in what the other person has to say. Don’t avoid eye contact, as this can make the other person feel like you’re not listening.<br><br><strong>Don’t Drink Too Much Alcohol</strong><br><br>Alcohol can help to ease the tension on a first date, but don’t overdo it. Drinking too much can make you say or do things that you may regret later. Stick to one or two drinks and keep your wits about you.<br><br><strong>Don’t Wear Something Uncomfortable</strong><br><br>It’s important to dress to impress on a first date, but don’t wear something that makes you feel uncomfortable. If you’re not comfortable in what you’re wearing, it can make you feel self-conscious and it can affect your confidence. Wear something that makes you feel confident and comfortable.<br><br>Following these tips can help to ensure that your first date goes as smoothly as possible. Keep an open mind, be present in the conversation, and don’t do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. With these tips in mind, you’ll be sure to have a successful first date.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://siteoff.github.io/registration"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA1.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
