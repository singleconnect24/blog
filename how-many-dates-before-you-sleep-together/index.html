                     <p><br>The age-old question of how many dates before you sleep together has been asked by many couples throughout the years. The answer to this question is not a one-size-fits-all answer, as each couple is different and has different comfort levels. However, research has shown that on average, men reported waiting about five dates, and women reported a preference of waiting closer to nine dates. Overall the average was about eight dates.<br><br><strong>What Does the Research Say?</strong><br><br>Research conducted by the Kinsey Institute in 2019 showed that the average number of dates before sleeping together was 8. The study surveyed 1,000 men and women between the ages of 18 and 24 and found that men reported waiting an average of five dates before sleeping together, while women reported a preference of waiting closer to nine dates.<br><br><strong>What Factors Influence How Many Dates Before You Sleep Together?</strong><br><br>There are a variety of factors that can influence how many dates a couple should wait before sleeping together. These include:<br><br>• Relationship Status: If you are in a committed relationship, you may feel more comfortable sleeping together sooner than if you are casually dating.<br><br>• Comfort Level: Each person’s comfort level is different, so it is important to take into account how comfortable you both feel about sleeping together.<br><br>• Religious Beliefs: If you have strong religious beliefs, you may want to wait longer before sleeping together.<br><br>• Age: Younger couples may feel more comfortable sleeping together sooner than older couples.<br><br>• Expectations: If you have certain expectations for the relationship, you may want to wait until you are sure the relationship is headed in the right direction before sleeping together.<br><br>The answer to the question of how many dates before you sleep together is not a one-size-fits-all answer.
