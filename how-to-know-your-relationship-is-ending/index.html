                     <p>When it comes to relationships, it can be difficult to know when it's time to move on. Knowing the signs that your relationship is ending can help you make the right decision for your emotional wellbeing. Here are some of the key indicators that it's time to move on.<br><br>No Emotional Connection<br>One of the key signs your relationship is ending is that you are no longer vulnerable and open with your partner. A cornerstone of happy, healthy relationships is that both partners feel comfortable being truly open to sharing thoughts and opinions with one another. If you find yourself avoiding conversations or no longer feeling comfortable expressing your feelings, it could be a sign that your relationship is coming to an end.<br><br>Lack of Intimacy<br>Another sign that your relationship is coming to an end is a lack of physical intimacy. Intimacy is an important part of any relationship, and when it's lacking, it can be a sign that the relationship is not as strong as it once was. If you find yourself avoiding physical contact with your partner, it could be a sign that your relationship is coming to an end.<br><br>Lack of Communication<br>Communication is key in any relationship, and when it's lacking, it can be a sign that the relationship is coming to an end. If you find yourself avoiding conversations or no longer feeling comfortable expressing your feelings, it could be a sign that your relationship is coming to an end.<br><br>Unresolved Conflict<br>Conflict is inevitable in any relationship, but it's important to be able to resolve it in a healthy way. If you find yourself unable to resolve conflicts with your partner, it could be a sign that your relationship is coming to an end.<br><br>Unmet Needs<br>When two people are in a relationship, it's important that both of their needs are being met. If you find yourself feeling unfulfilled or unappreciated in the relationship, it could be a sign that your relationship is coming to an end.<br><br>Lack of Trust<br>Trust is essential in any relationship, and when it's lacking, it can be a sign that the relationship is coming to an end. If you find yourself unable to trust your partner or feeling like your partner is not trustworthy, it could be a sign that your relationship is coming to an end.<br><br>No Longer Enjoying Time Together<br>Finally, if you find yourself no longer enjoying spending time with your partner, it could be a sign that your relationship is coming to an end. When two people are in a healthy relationship, they should enjoy spending time together and look forward to it. If you find yourself dreading time with your partner, it could be a sign that your relationship is coming to an end.<br><br>Knowing the signs that your relationship is ending can help you make the right decision for your emotional wellbeing. If you find yourself experiencing any of the signs mentioned above, it could be a sign that it's time to move on.</p>
