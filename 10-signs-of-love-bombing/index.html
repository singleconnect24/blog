It is characterized by excessive displays of affection, attention, and compliments. Love bombing can be difficult to recognize, as it often starts off as a seemingly harmless display of affection. Here are 10 signs of love bombing to watch out for.<br><br>1. Inappropriate Gifts<br><br>One of the most common signs of love bombing is the giving of inappropriate gifts. These gifts are often extravagant and are given with the intention of manipulating the recipient into feeling obligated to the giver.<br><br>2. Never-Ending Compliments<br><br>Another sign of love bombing is the giving of never-ending compliments. The giver will shower the recipient with compliments in an attempt to make them feel special and appreciated.<br><br>3. Excessive Communication<br><br>Love bombers will often attempt to control their victims by bombarding them with excessive communication. This can take the form of constant phone calls, text messages, emails, and social media messages.<br><br>4. Constant Attention<br><br>Love bombers will often attempt to control their victims by demanding constant attention. They may become jealous and possessive if the victim does not give them the attention they feel they deserve.<br><br>5. “Soulmate” Claims<br><br>Love bombers will often attempt to manipulate their victims by claiming to be their “soulmate”. This is a form of emotional manipulation that is designed to make the victim feel special and unique.<br><br>6. Demanding Commitment<br><br>Love bombers will often attempt to manipulate their victims by demanding commitment. They may pressure the victim into making a commitment before they are ready or before they have had a chance to get to know the person.<br><br>7. Disrespecting Boundaries<br><br>Love bombers will often attempt to manipulate their victims by disregarding their boundaries. They may ignore the victim’s requests for space or privacy and continue to pursue them even when they have made it clear that they are not interested.<br><br>8. Neediness<br><br>Love bombers will often attempt to manipulate their victims by exhibiting neediness. They may become clingy and dependent on the victim for emotional support and validation.<br><br>9. Unreasonable Expectations<br><br>Love bombers will often attempt to manipulate their victims by setting unreasonable expectations. They may expect the victim to drop everything and cater to their every need.<br><br>10. Unwillingness to Compromise<br><br>Love bombers will often attempt to manipulate their victims by refusing to compromise. They may become angry and resentful if the victim does not meet their demands.<br><br>Recognizing the signs of love bombing is the first step in protecting yourself from manipulation and exploitation. If you suspect that someone is love bombing you, it is important to set boundaries and distance yourself from the person.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
