Red flags on a first date are warning signs that may indicate that the person you are seeing is not the right match for you. These signs can range from obvious to subtle, and can be physical, verbal, or behavioral. Paying attention to these red flags can help you avoid wasting time on a relationship that is doomed from the start.</p><h3>3 Red Flags to Look Out for on Your First 3 Dates with Someone New</h3><p><strong>They're Late to Your Dates</strong><br><br>One of the most common red flags on a first date is if the person is consistently late. If they are late to your first date, it could be a sign that they are not taking the date seriously or that they don’t value your time. If they are late to the second and third dates, it could be a sign that they are not invested in the relationship and don’t care about making an effort.<br><br><strong>They Drink Too Much</strong><br><br>Another red flag to look out for on a first date is if the person drinks too much. If they are drinking more than you are, it could be a sign that they are trying to mask their insecurities or that they have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. It could also be a sign that they are not mature enough to handle the responsibility of a relationship.<br><br><strong>They Seem Almost *Too* Into You</strong><br><br>Finally, if the person seems almost too into you on the first date, it could be a sign that they are desperate for a relationship or that they are not being genuine. If they are constantly complimenting you or trying to move the relationship forward too quickly, it could be a sign that they are not being honest about their feelings or intentions.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>It is important to pay attention to red flags on a first date in order to avoid wasting time on a relationship that is doomed from the start. By being aware of the signs, you can make sure that you are investing your time and energy into a relationship that has the potential to last.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">SingleConnect, 1993-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://singleconnect24.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
